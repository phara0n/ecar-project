# Project Checkpoint - ECAR Garage Management System

## Current Status

As of May 20, 2024, the ECAR garage management system is in active development. The following highlights the current state of the project:

### Components Implemented
- ✅ Customer management (list, create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Vehicle management (list, create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Customer-Vehicle relationship management
- ✅ API integration with backend services
- ✅ UI components using shadcn/ui

### Recent Changes
- Updated API endpoints from 'vehicles' to 'cars' to match backend structure
- Fixed customer filtering in the Vehicles component
- Implemented "View Vehicles" capability from the customer list

### Recent Bugfixes
- Fixed SelectItem component error in Vehicles.tsx by replacing empty string value with "all"
- Updated customer filtering logic to handle the "all" value appropriately
- Ensured URL parameters sync correctly with the UI state
- Fixed vehicle creation/update error by transforming the customer field to customer_id
- Updated vehicle API to use PATCH instead of PUT for better compatibility with backend

## Known Issues
- Error when submitting forms with empty values for required fields
- Need to implement service history view for vehicles
- UI needs responsiveness improvements for mobile devices

## Next Steps
1. Complete service history functionality for vehicles
2. Implement vehicle details page
3. Add appointment scheduling functionality
4. Implement dashboard analytics
5. Improve error handling across the application

## API Integration Status
The application is successfully connecting to the backend API with endpoints:
- Customer endpoints: `/api/customers/`
- Vehicle endpoints: `/api/cars/`
- Service endpoints: `/api/services/`

Authentication is working correctly with JWT tokens.

## UI Component Status
Currently using shadcn/ui components for a consistent design system. The recent error with SelectItem components indicates we need to be careful about component requirements:

> The `<Select.Item />` component must have a value prop that is not an empty string because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

## Documentation
- API endpoints documented in vehicle_management_implementation.md
- Customer management implementation documented
- Need to update service management documentation
