# ECAR Project - Development Checkpoint

## Project Overview
ECAR Garage Management System is a comprehensive solution for Tunisian automotive workshops, consisting of:
- Backend API (Django + DRF)
- Mobile Apps (React Native)
- Admin Web Interface (React + TypeScript)

## Current Development Phase

- **Status**: Basic dashboard and customers pages implemented with responsive layout

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: ShadCN UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Component Variants**: Class Variance Authority
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect (Redux Toolkit to be added)

## Modules to Implement
1. **Dashboard**
   - [x] Real-time metrics (mocked)
   - [ ] Interactive charts (Chart.js)
   
2. **Management**
   - [x] CRUD for customers (listing with mock data)
   - [ ] CRUD for vehicles
   - [ ] CRUD for services
   - [ ] Bulk import/export (CSV/Excel)
   
3. **Invoicing**
   - [ ] Generate PDFs 
   - [ ] Preview invoices
   
4. **SuperAdmin Settings Panel**
   - [ ] User Management
   - [ ] Role Assignment
   - [ ] Access Control
   - [ ] Security Logs

## Current Progress
- [x] Initialize React 19 project with Vite 6.2.0
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS v4.1.3
- [x] Set up ShadCN UI with New York style theme
- [x] Configure light/dark mode with CSS variables
- [x] Create proper project directory structure
- [x] Add ShadCN components (Button, Card, Avatar, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, etc.)
- [x] Set up utility functions for class merging
- [x] Configure ESLint for code quality
- [x] Implement responsive layout with sidebar and header
- [x] Create mobile-friendly navigation with Sheet component
- [x] Set up protected routes with React Router
- [x] Create mock authentication system
- [x] Implement dashboard overview with statistics cards

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement other ShadCN UI components for forms and data display
2. Set up Redux Toolkit + RTK Query for state management
3. Build API service layer to connect with Django backend
4. Create vehicles management page with CRUD functionality
5. Implement services tracking interface
6. Build appointment scheduling system
7. Develop invoicing and reporting features
