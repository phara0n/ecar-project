# ECAR Project Checkpoint - April 2, 2025

## Current Status

We have successfully built the admin web interface using React, Vite, TypeScript, and React Admin. The interface is operational but has required several critical fixes to resolve issues that prevented proper functioning.

## Recent Fixes

### 1. i18n Import Error Fix
- **Issue**: 500 errors when attempting to load language files
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic imports with synchronous fallbacks for language files
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Details**: French and English languages are now supported; Arabic was temporarily removed to fix errors

### 2. JWT Token Decoding Error Fix
- **Issue**: Authentication errors due to incorrect jwt-decode usage
- **Solution**: Updated the import and usage of jwt-decode library
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Details**: Changed from namespace import to named import pattern and updated all usage instances

## Current Working Features

- ✅ Project setup with React + Vite + TypeScript
- ✅ React Admin integration
- ✅ Internationalization with English and French support
- ✅ Authentication system with JWT
- ✅ Basic resource structure

## Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Verify login functionality
   - Test token refresh mechanism
   - Confirm permissions are working correctly

2. **Complete Resource Integration**
   - Implement data providers for all resources
   - Connect to backend API endpoints
   - Test CRUD operations

3. **UI Refinement**
   - Customize layout to match ECAR branding
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add custom components for specific business needs

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Dashboard with metrics and analytics
   - PDF generation for invoices
   - Bulk operations for customer and vehicle data

## Known Issues

1. **Arabic Language Support**
   - Arabic language support is temporarily disabled
   - Need to properly implement and test RTL support
   - Plan to re-enable in next sprint

2. **API Integration**
   - Some backend endpoints may require custom data provider adaptations
   - Need to ensure proper handling of JWT token refresh
   - May need to adjust error handling for specific API responses

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the established project structure
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Implement i18n for all user-facing text
- Test thoroughly in both English and French interfaces
- Document all API integrations and custom components

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ecar/ecar_project/web-admin && npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the admin interface at http://localhost:5173

3. Log in with the following credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: Phara0n$

4. Test the interface in both English and French languages

This checkpoint document will be updated as we make progress on the admin interface implementation.
