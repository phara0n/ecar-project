## Notes and Reminders

- Follow proper branching strategy - create feature branches from dev
- Use Conventional Commits format for all commits
- Make sure all tests pass before creating pull requests
- Run serializer validation script after any model or serializer changes
- Keep for_mehd.md updated with progress
- Deploy changes to test environment after completing major features

## Issues to Address

- Add detailed docstrings to remaining viewsets
- Review security settings for production deployment
- Evaluate need for additional caching
- Plan for frontend component structure
- Implement and test Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider adding query optimization for complex endpoints

---

Excellent progress today! We've resolved several critical issues with the Swagger documentation and PgBouncer. The API documentation now works correctly with improved organization through operation tags, and we've implemented a robust validation system to prevent future serializer-model mismatches. PgBouncer is functioning properly without health check configuration. We've also simplified the invoice system by removing tax calculation entirely per requirements and successfully migrated the database schema. Docker environment is fully operational with all containers working correctly. We're now ready to begin frontend development while continuing to optimize the backend. All systems are stable and documented.
