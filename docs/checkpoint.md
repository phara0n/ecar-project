## Known Issues
- Need to test customer management with actual backend data
- Need to verify error handling for all API endpoints
- Mobile responsive design needs additional testing
- Backend implementation of on_delete=CASCADE for user-customer relationship should be verified

## Next Development Phase
1. Complete service history view for vehicles
2. Implement services management functionality
3. Build appointments scheduling system with calendar interface
4. Develop invoice generation and payment tracking
5. Create comprehensive dashboard with analytics
