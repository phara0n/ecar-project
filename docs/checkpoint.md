---

Excellent progress today! We've successfully implemented Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the API and made it accessible through both Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces. The API documentation now provides interactive testing capabilities and detailed information about available endpoints. Tomorrow we'll focus on beginning frontend development and enhancing API testing.
