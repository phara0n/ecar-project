# ECAR Project Development Checkpoint

## Project Overview
The ECAR Garage Management System is a comprehensive solution for Tunisian automotive workshops, consisting of:
- Mobile Apps (React Native)
- Backend API (Django + DRF)
- Admin Web Interface (React + React Admin + TypeScript)
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Infrastructure (Ubuntu VPS + Docker)

## Current Development Focus: Admin Web Interface

We are currently implementing the admin web interface using React, Material UI, and the Mantis template design system. This interface will be fully integrated with the Django REST Framework backend running in Docker.

## Completed Components

2. Create basic CRUD views for main entities (customers, vehicles, services)
3. Develop dashboard analytics components
4. Implement advanced features like PDF generation

## Backend API Endpoints Integration Status

The admin dashboard needs to integrate with these backend endpoints:

```
# Authentication Endpoints
/api/auth/token/ (POST - obtain token) ✅
/api/auth/token/refresh/ (POST - refresh token) ✅
/api/auth/register/ (POST - register new user) ✅
/api/auth/change-password/ (PUT - change password) ✅
/api/auth/logout/ (POST - logout) ✅

# Customer Management
/api/customers/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/customers/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅

# Vehicle Management
/api/cars/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/cars/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅
/api/cars/{id}/mileage_history/ (GET) ✅
/api/cars/{id}/next_service_prediction/ (GET) ✅
/api/cars/{id}/report_mileage/ (POST) ✅

# Mileage Update Management
/api/mileage-updates/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/mileage-updates/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅

# Service Interval Management
/api/service-intervals/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/service-intervals/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅
/api/service-intervals/for_vehicle/ (GET) ✅

# Service Management
/api/services/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/services/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅
/api/service-items/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/service-items/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅

# Invoice Management
/api/invoices/ (GET, POST) ✅
/api/invoices/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE) ✅
/api/invoices/{id}/refund/ (POST) ✅

# Notification Management
/api/notifications/ (GET, POST)
/api/notifications/{id}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE)
/api/notifications/{id}/mark-read/ (PUT)

# Dashboard Data
/api/admin/dashboard/ (GET - analytics data)
```

## Testing

We've created an API Test page at `/api-test` that demonstrates our integration with the backend. This page serves as a practical demonstration of:

1. JWT Authentication: Displays the current logged-in user retrieved from the backend
2. Customer Data: Shows the first 5 customers from the database with basic info
3. Vehicle Data: Displays vehicles with filtering by customer
4. Error Handling: Proper handling of loading states and errors

This test page can be accessed via the sidebar navigation and provides a quick way to verify the backend connectivity is working properly.

## Authentication Flow

We've implemented a complete JWT authentication flow:

1. **Login**: Users enter credentials which are sent to `/api/auth/token/` to obtain JWT tokens
2. **Token Storage**: Access and refresh tokens are securely stored in localStorage
3. **API Authorization**: All API requests automatically include the JWT token in the Authorization header
4. **Session Validation**: MainLayout checks for token existence and uses `getCurrentUser` to verify validity
5. **Token Refresh**: Implementation ready for automatic token refresh when needed
6. **Logout**: Properly handles logout by calling the backend API and clearing stored tokens
7. **Error Handling**: Properly handles authentication errors and redirects to login when needed

## New Features Support

We've now added support for the mileage-based service prediction feature of the ECAR system by implementing:

1. Vehicle API with mileage history and service prediction endpoints
2. Service Interval management API
3. Mileage Update tracking API
4. Service and service item management API
5. Invoice management API with refund functionality

These APIs will allow us to build interfaces for:
- Viewing a vehicle's complete mileage history
- Predicting when the next service will be needed
- Managing service intervals based on vehicle make/model
- Recording new mileage readings
- Tracking service history and invoices
- Processing payments and refunds

## Technical Requirements
- All components must be fully TypeScript compliant
- Components must adapt to role-based permissions from the backend
- UI should respect the theming system for consistent appearance
- Form validation should match backend validation requirements
- All API requests must include JWT authentication

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed authentication to use real JWT tokens instead of mock authentication
- Updated Material UI components to follow v7 guidelines (Grid component updates)
- Fixed CORS issues by updating credentials mode in the baseQuery configuration
- Improved ListItem usage to remove warnings about non-boolean button attribute
- Added proper loading and error states for authentication
- Implemented JWT token decoding to extract user data locally instead of relying on a backend endpoint
- Updated Notification component to use the correct Grid API in MUI v7
- Ensured consistent API endpoint usage throughout the application

## Theme and UI Updates

### Theme Configuration (April 9, 2023)
We've resolved several critical issues with the theme system:

- ✅ Fixed 500 Internal Server Error from theme initialization
- ✅ Simplified theme configuration structure for better reliability
- ✅ Updated shadows implementation to work with MUI v7
- ✅ Added proper font loading (@fontsource packages)
- ✅ Added missing @ant-design/colors dependency
- ✅ Fixed router configuration to avoid duplication
- ✅ Cleaned up component imports and structure

These fixes ensure that:
1. The application loads without critical errors
2. UI components display with proper styling
3. The theme system is maintainable and extensible
4. Fonts load correctly and are applied consistently

### MUI v7 Compatibility 
We've also updated several components to ensure they work properly with Material UI v7:

- ✅ Grid components updated to use the new API (cols instead of xs)
- ✅ ListItem components updated to use ListItemButton
- ✅ Fixed header component layout

### Pending UI Updates
- ⏳ Update remaining components to use MUI v7 APIs
- ⏳ Implement color mode toggling (dark/light)
- ⏳ Create theme variations for different sections
