- Invoice generation

### 3. User Authentication and Authorization
âœ… **Status**: Complete and functioning

**Key Components**:
- User registration and login
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Permission management
- User profile management

### 4. Car Management
âœ… **Status**: Complete and functioning

**Key Components**:
- Car registration
- Car details management
- Mileage tracking and history
- Service history
- Next service prediction

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
âœ… **Status**: Implemented and ready for deployment

**Key Components**:
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment
- Backend CI pipeline with PostgreSQL integration
- Frontend CI pipeline with build verification
- Production deployment automation
- Database backup automation
- Documentation validation checks

**Recent Updates**:
- Implemented 4 GitHub Actions workflows
- Created deployment scripts for automatic updates
- Added database backup functionality
- Set up documentation validation pipeline
- Created comprehensive CI/CD documentation

## In Progress

### 1. Notification System
ðŸ”„ **Status**: Partially implemented, needs further testing

**Key Components**:
- Email notifications for service due
- Push notifications for mobile app
- Notification preferences management
- SMS notifications (planned)

### 2. Analytics Dashboard
ðŸ”„ **Status**: In development

**Key Components**:
- Service history analytics
- Mileage tracking visualization
- Revenue reporting
- Popular service types analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Complete API Documentation**
   - Ensure all endpoints have proper Swagger documentation
   - Create comprehensive API usage guides

2. **Implement Advanced Notification System**
   - Finalize SMS notification integration
   - Add customizable notification templates
   - Implement notification preferences management

3. **Enhance Analytics Dashboard**
   - Complete mileage tracking visualization
   - Add predictive maintenance analytics
   - Implement customer retention metrics

4. **Mobile App Integration Testing**
   - Test service history viewing in mobile app
   - Test mileage reporting from mobile app
   - Test service booking from mobile app

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries for service prediction
   - Implement caching for frequent API calls
   - Optimize Docker configuration for production

6. **Configure CI/CD Secrets**
   - Set up required secrets in GitHub repository settings
   - Create environment configurations for production
   - Test deployment pipeline with a small change

## Technical Debt

1. **Refactor Prediction Algorithm**
   - Improve performance of average daily mileage calculation
   - Add more sophisticated prediction algorithms based on usage patterns

2. **Test Coverage Improvement**
   - Add unit tests for service history integration
   - Implement integration tests for the complete prediction workflow

3. **Code Documentation**
   - Improve inline documentation for complex algorithms
   - Create developer guides for extending the system

## Issues and Blockers

1. **Swagger Documentation Generation - RESOLVED**
   - Issue: OpenAPI schema generation was failing due to field errors in serializers
   - Root Cause: `ServiceItemSerializer` and `ServiceItemDocsSerializer` included fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, and `line_total`) that don't exist in the `ServiceItem` model
   - Solution: 
     - Fixed the serializers to include only valid fields from the model
     - Added proper method field for `total_price` calculation
     - Successfully verified that both Swagger UI and OpenAPI schema now function correctly

2. **GitHub Actions Environment Configuration - TO BE ADDRESSED**
   - Issue: Linting errors in GitHub Actions workflow files
   - Specific errors with `environment: production` syntax
   - Will be fixed before running the first automated deployment

## Current Development Environment

- Django 4.2.x
- PostgreSQL 14.x
- Redis 6.x
- Docker-compose for containerization
- React 18.x for frontend
- JWT for authentication
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Deployment Status

- **Development**: Running latest code with service prediction
- **Staging**: Running latest code with service prediction
- **Production**: Pending deployment of service prediction feature
- **CI/CD**: Workflows created and ready to be configured with secrets

## Recent Migrations

- `0007_car_average_daily_mileage_car_last_service_date_and_more.py`
- `0008_service_is_routine_maintenance_service_service_type_and_more.py`
