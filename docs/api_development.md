## Notes on API Development
- All endpoints use proper authentication and permission handling
- Rate limiting is implemented for sensitive operations
- Cache decorators are used for read-heavy endpoints
- Custom permissions verify owner access or staff status
- Advanced filtering is available on list endpoints
- Bulk operations available for admin users
- PDF upload support for invoices instead of generation

## Next Steps
1. Complete the JWT authentication implementation
2. Set up the car management endpoints
3. Implement notification management endpoints
4. Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive documentation
