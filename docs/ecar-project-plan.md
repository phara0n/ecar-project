# ECAR Garage Management System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Building a self-hosted Tunisian garage management system with:
- Django backend with REST API (JWT authentication)
- React Native mobile app for customers (iOS/Android)
- React + Vite admin web interface (separate from Django Admin)
- Multi-language support (French primary, Arabic secondary with RTL)
- Offline capabilities and secure authentication
- Self-hosted deployment on Ubuntu VPS in Tunisia

## System Architecture
1. **Backend (Django + DRF)**
   - JWT Authentication with role-based access control
   - PostgreSQL Database 
   - Redis caching for performance
   - PDF Generation for invoices (ReportLab)
   - CORS and rate limiting for security
   - Audit logging for critical actions

2. **Customer Mobile App (React Native + TypeScript)**
   - Service tracking and history
   - Push notifications via Firebase
   - Offline capability with SQLite
   - Multi-language support (French/Arabic with RTL)
   - JWT-based secure authentication

3. **Admin Web Interface (React + Vite + Ant Design)**
   - Dashboard with interactive charts
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - CSV/Excel import/export
   - Role-based access (super-admin, technician)
   - PDF invoice preview and generation

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Ubuntu 22.04 VPS (minimum 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 50GB SSD)
   - Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
   - NGINX + Gunicorn for Django
   - PostgreSQL + Redis
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Daily automated backups

## Security & Compliance
- All data stored on Tunisian VPS (data residency)
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt SSL
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields
- JWT roles + IP whitelisting for admin web
- Audit logs for critical actions
- Strong password policies

## Current Progress
- ✅ Django backend structure created with core and API apps
- ✅ Data models defined and relationships established
- ✅ REST API with JWT authentication implemented
- ✅ Role-based permissions and security features
- ✅ Initial database set up with SQLite for development
- ✅ PDF invoice generation system implemented
- ✅ Email notification system with templates
- ✅ Redis caching integration for performance
- ✅ Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose setup

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Complete database migration to PostgreSQL for production
   - Implement AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Set up daily automated backups
   - Implement SMS notification capability

2. **Admin Web Interface Development**:
   - Set up React + Vite project with TypeScript
   - Implement Ant Design admin templates
   - Create dashboard with analytics
   - Build service management interface
   - Implement user management with roles

3. **Mobile App Development**:
   - Complete React Native project setup with TypeScript
   - Implement secure token storage
   - Create service history timeline UI
   - Build multi-language support with RTL layout
   - Implement offline storage with SQLite

4. **DevOps & Deployment**:
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Configure production deployment
   - Set up monitoring and error tracking with Sentry
   - Implement IP whitelisting for admin portal
