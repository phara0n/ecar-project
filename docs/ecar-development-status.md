- Initial database setup with SQLite (migration to PostgreSQL planned)
- PDF invoice generation using ReportLab
- Email notification system for invoices and service updates
- Audit logging for critical models (`django-auditlog`)
- API rate limiting (`django-ratelimit`) and security enhancements
- CORS configuration for allowed domains
- Redis caching for improved API performance
- PDF invoice generation system implemented
- Email notification system set up with templates
- Basic GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured for backend testing

### DevOps
- Dockerfile for Django backend
- Docker Compose setup with:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Django (Gunicorn)
  - NGINX
  - Redis
- Environment configuration template with security settings
- Let's Encrypt SSL configuration (development setup)

## In Progress (üîÑ)

### Backend (Django)
- Database migration to PostgreSQL for production
- Custom admin dashboard with analytics
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive customer data fields
- Strong password policies implementation
- Implementing daily PostgreSQL backups to `/backups`

### Admin Web Interface (React + Vite + Ant Design)

- Authentication screens using JWT
- Implementing Ant Design (AntD) prebuilt admin templates
- Dashboard layouts and navigation

### Mobile App (React Native)
- Initial project setup with TypeScript
- Authentication screens with secure token storage
- Redux Toolkit implementation for state management

## To Do (üìã)

### Backend (Django)
- Complete automated backup system with SFTP export
- Unit and integration tests
- Error monitoring using Sentry
- SMS notification capability via Tunisian gateway

### Admin Web Interface (React + Vite + Ant Design)

2. Create automated database backup solution with SFTP export
3. Continue Admin Web Interface development with Ant Design components
4. Begin Mobile App development with authentication and vehicle management
5. Implement remaining security enhancements (IP whitelisting, encryption)
