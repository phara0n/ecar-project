# ECAR Project Development Status

**Updated: April 1, 2025**

## Executive Summary

The ECAR Garage Management System has made significant progress with the completion of core backend API development. We've successfully implemented customer management, vehicle service history, and invoice management APIs with comprehensive features. The infrastructure is stable with PostgreSQL (using PgBouncer for connection pooling), Redis caching, and containerized deployment. 

Our focus is now shifting to JWT authentication enhancements and frontend development using React and Ant Design.

## Completed Components

- ✅ Nginx web server configuration
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Environment configuration

### Backend Development (85%)
- ✅ Django and Django REST Framework setup
- ✅ Core models and migrations
- ✅ Admin panel configuration
- ✅ Customer management API (search, filtering, bulk operations)
- ✅ Vehicle service history API (status management, statistics)
- ✅ Invoice management API with PDF upload functionality
- ✅ JWT authentication enhancements (completed)
  - Completed tasks:
    - ✅ Implemented JWT token rotation and blacklisting
    - ✅ Added enhanced user information in token payload
    - ✅ Created token blacklist endpoint for secure logout
    - ✅ Added IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
    - ✅ Improved security with token expiration settings
    - ✅ Added comprehensive logging for authentication events
- 🔲 Car management API (planned)
- 🔲 Notification API (planned)

### Documentation (100%)
- ✅ API documentation for all endpoints
- ✅ Setup and deployment guides
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Database performance optimization guidelines
