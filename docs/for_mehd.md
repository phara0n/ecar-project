## Current Status Update - April 2, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Swagger Documentation 500 Error**: Fixed the Swagger documentation error that was causing a 500 Internal Server Error. The issue was in the `InvoiceSerializer` where we had incorrectly included the 'tax_rate' field which was removed from the Invoice model. Updated the serializer to include 'pdf_file' field instead and ensure all fields match the model properties.

2. **Database Connection**: PgBouncer is now properly configured and functioning with the application.

3. **Docker Integrity Check**: Verified all Docker containers are running correctly. Fixed an issue with the InvoiceSerializer that was causing Swagger documentation to fail with a 500 error. The serializer was referencing a `tax_amount` field that no longer exists in the Invoice model. After removing this field reference, the Swagger documentation now loads correctly.

### Current Work

1. **API Documentation Enhancement**:
   - ✅ Fixed Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - ✅ Resolved serializer-model field mismatches
   - ✅ Added comprehensive examples to API documentation
   - ✅ Enhanced endpoint descriptions with operation summaries
   - ✅ Organized endpoints with proper tags for better navigation

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Setting up React admin interface structure
   - Configuring Vite and Ant Design
   - Creating project layout and component architecture
   - Implementing authentication screens

3. **Docker Environment**:
   - ✅ All Docker containers functioning correctly
   - ✅ Fixed issues with Swagger documentation in Docker environment
   - ✅ Streamlined deployment process

### Next Steps

1. **Complete API Documentation**:
   - ✅ Add more comprehensive examples to API documentation
   - ✅ Enhance endpoint descriptions and operation summaries
   - ✅ Organize endpoints with proper tags for better navigation
   - ✅ Create example API request collection (Postman/Insomnia)
   - ✅ Document common API usage patterns

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Begin work on React admin interface
   - Configure Vite and Ant Design
   - Implement authentication screens
   - Set up initial dashboard components
   - Create vehicle management interface
   - Implement service scheduler
   - Develop invoice viewing with PDF preview

3. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Develop more comprehensive API endpoint tests
   - Implement test coverage reporting
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Create integration tests for critical workflows
   - Implement frontend component testing
   
4. **Security Hardening**:
   - Review authentication implementation for best practices
   - Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
   - Add rate limiting to all sensitive endpoints
   - Configure CORS headers for frontend integration
   - Implement request validation middleware
   - Add security headers to Nginx configuration

## Development Schedule
- Morning (9:00-12:00): Frontend Setup - React admin interface with Ant Design
- Afternoon (13:00-17:00): API Integration & Authentication Flow
- Evening (17:00-18:00): Documentation Updates & Test Framework Setup

## Important Notes
- Follow branching strategy (feature branches from dev)
- Use Conventional Commits
- Ensure test coverage
- Regular documentation updates
- Test environment deployments
- Always validate serializers after model changes to prevent Swagger documentation issues

## Next Update
This document will be updated daily with progress and new developments.
