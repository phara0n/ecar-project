# ECAR Project Update for Team

## Recent Changes and Current Status

### Fixed UI Issues
- Fixed a critical UI error in the Vehicles page where the Select component was failing due to an empty string value
- Updated customer filtering to use "all" as the value instead of an empty string to comply with shadcn/ui Select component requirements
- Ensured URL parameters and UI state are properly synchronized
- Fixed vehicle creation/update error by transforming the customer field to customer_id for API calls
- Updated vehicle API to use PATCH instead of PUT for better compatibility with backend

### API Integration Updates
- Corrected API endpoints in the frontend to use `/cars/` instead of `/vehicles/` to match the backend structure
- All vehicle management operations (list, create, edit, delete) are now working correctly with the backend

## Shadcn/UI Component Notes
Some important notes about the shadcn/ui components we're using:

1. `<Select.Item />` components must have a non-empty string value
2. Form validation should be done before submission
3. Always include proper loading states for async operations
4. Use toast notifications for user feedback
