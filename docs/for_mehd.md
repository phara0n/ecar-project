## Current Status Update - April 2, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Swagger Documentation 500 Error**: Fixed the Swagger documentation error that was causing a 500 Internal Server Error. The issue was in the `InvoiceSerializer` where we had incorrectly included the 'tax_rate' field which was removed from the Invoice model. Updated the serializer to include 'pdf_file' field instead and ensure all fields match the model properties.

2. **Database Connection**: PgBouncer is now properly configured and functioning with the application.

3. **Docker Integrity Check**: Verified all Docker containers are running correctly. Fixed an issue with the InvoiceSerializer that was causing Swagger documentation to fail with a 500 error. The serializer was referencing a `tax_amount` field that no longer exists in the Invoice model. After removing this field reference, the Swagger documentation now loads correctly.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Fixed Django Admin Logout Issue (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed error when attempting to logout from Django Admin
- **Cause**: Django's admin logout view expects POST requests, but the browser was making GET requests
- **Solution**: Updated the custom_logout view to accept both GET and POST methods using @require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
- **Impact**: Users can now successfully logout from the Django Admin interface in the Docker environment
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/api/views.py` (updated custom_logout function)
  - Added documentation in `docs/troubleshooting.md`

### Updated Logout Redirect URL (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: After logout, users were being redirected to `/api/docs/` instead of the admin login page
- **Solution**: Modified the redirect URL in custom_logout function and LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL setting
- **Impact**: Users now get redirected to the admin login page after logout for a better user experience
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/api/views.py` (updated custom_logout function's default redirect URL)
  - `backend/ecar_backend/settings.py` (updated LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL and Swagger settings)

### Removed Tax Fields from Invoice Model (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: ProgrammingError when accessing Invoice admin: "column core_invoice.tax_rate does not exist"
- **Cause**: Model definition included tax_rate field, but it didn't exist in the database
- **Solution**:

  - Added migration file to fix database schema

### Completed Invoice Tax Removal (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: AttributeError: 'Invoice' object has no attribute 'tax_rate' when viewing or editing invoices
- **Cause**: While the tax_rate field was removed from the model, references to it remained in PDF generation and API views
- **Solution**:
  - Removed tax_rate reference from PDF generation in utils/pdf_utils.py
  - Removed tax_rate reference from bulk invoice creation in API views
  - Updated invoice_created.html email template to remove tax display

  - Simplified the InvoiceForm to use Django's standard admin widgets
  - Added ServiceItemInlineForInvoice to allow managing service items directly in the invoice admin
  - Removed custom CSS and templates for better consistency with Django admin
  - Properly filtered service items to show only those related to the selected service
- **Impact**: Users can now add and manage service items directly from the invoice admin interface
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/core/admin.py` (updated InvoiceAdmin to use standard widgets and added ServiceItemInlineForInvoice)
  - Removed custom CSS and template files

### Fixed Backend Restart Loop (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: Backend container was continuously restarting due to an admin configuration error
- **Cause**: `ServiceItemInlineForInvoice` class was configured incorrectly - `ServiceItem` model doesn't have a direct ForeignKey to `Invoice`
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced inline approach with a custom read-only field using `get_service_items` method
  - Used HTML table to display service items associated with the invoice's service
  - Implemented custom fieldsets to organize the invoice admin form 
  - Completely removed the problematic inline class that was causing the restart loop
- **Impact**: Backend container now starts and runs normally, allowing admin interface to function properly
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/core/admin.py` (updated ServiceItem display in Invoice admin)

### Fixed Invoice Form FieldError (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: FieldError when adding a new invoice: "'issued_date' cannot be specified for Invoice model form as it is a non-editable field"
- **Cause**: The `issued_date` field was included in the editable form fields in the admin interface, but it's supposed to be non-editable
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `issued_date` from the fieldsets in the form
  - Added it to the readonly_fields list
  - Explicitly excluded it in the form's Meta class
- **Impact**: Users can now add invoices without encountering the FieldError
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/core/admin.py` (updated InvoiceForm and InvoiceAdmin)

### Implemented Data Protection Rules (April 2, 2025)
- **Enhancement**: Added business rules to protect related data from accidental deletion by non-superadmin users
- **Implementation**:
  - **Customer Protection**: Non-superadmins cannot delete customers who have cars
  - **Car Protection**: Non-superadmins cannot delete cars that have services
  - **Service Protection**: Non-superadmins cannot delete services that have service items or invoices
  - **Service Item Protection**: Only superadmins can delete service items
  - **Car Ownership Transfer**: All admins can transfer car ownership between customers, supporting the business case where a car owner can change
- **Impact**: Prevents accidental data loss while maintaining flexibility for legitimate business operations
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/core/admin.py` (added `has_delete_permission` methods to admin classes)

### Added Invoice Refund Functionality (April 2, 2025)

  - **Bulk Refund**: Select multiple invoices and use "Process refund for selected invoices" action
- **Impact**: Staff can now easily process refunds while maintaining a complete audit trail
- **Files Modified**:
  - Database schema updated with refund-related fields
  - `backend/core/admin.py` (added refund functionality to the admin interface)

### Fixed Backend Import Error (April 2, 2025)
- **Problem**: Backend container continuously restarting due to an import error
- **Cause**: Trying to import `ngettext` from `django.utils.text` instead of `django.utils.translation`
- **Solution**: Updated the import statement in admin.py to use the correct module
