# ECAR Project Update for Team

## Service Prediction System Implementation

I've created a comprehensive service prediction population script that initializes all the necessary data for the mileage-based service prediction system. This enhances our existing backend functionality by:

1. **Creating Service Intervals:** The script adds 10 different service interval types, including:
   - General intervals like Oil Change, Tire Rotation, and Brake Inspection
   - Make-specific intervals for Toyota, Volkswagen, and Mercedes
   - Model-specific intervals for specific car types

2. **Generating Historical Data:**
   - Creates realistic mileage update history for each vehicle
   - Builds service history records from existing services
   - Sets appropriate maintenance types and intervals

3. **Calculating Predictions:**
   - Updates all vehicles with predicted next service dates and mileages
   - Recalculates average daily mileage based on historical data

### How to Use
The script is now integrated into our database initialization process. When running `docker-compose up`, the backend will automatically:
1. Run migrations
2. Load sample data
3. Execute the service prediction population script

You can also run it manually with:
```bash
cd ecar_project/backend
python scripts/populate_service_prediction.py
```

### Documentation
I've created detailed documentation:
- `service_prediction_logic.md`: Explains the algorithm and logic
- `service_prediction_population.md`: Details how the population script works

### Next Steps
1. Test the service predictions through the API endpoints
2. Implement frontend components to display service predictions
3. Create notification triggers for upcoming services

## Backend Database Population Completed

I've created a complete database population solution for our backend:

### What's Been Done
- Created JSON fixture files for all major data entities:
  - Service intervals (oil changes, maintenance schedules, etc.)
  - Users and customers with sample data
  - Vehicles with detailed information
  - Services, service items, and invoices
  - Service history and mileage updates
  - Notifications

- Automated the database initialization process:
  - Created init_database.sh script that runs migrations and loads fixtures
  - Updated Docker Compose configuration to run the script automatically
  - Added check_db.sh script to verify database population

- Generated comprehensive documentation:
  - Created backend_database_population.md with detailed instructions
  - Updated checkpoint.md with current project status

### Sample Data Overview
- Created admin superuser (username: admin, password: admin123)
- Added 3 sample customers with user accounts
- Added 5 sample vehicles with appropriate data
- Added service records with items and invoices
- Added service history and mileage updates
- Added notifications for users

### How to Use
Simply run `docker-compose up` in the ecar_project directory. The database will be automatically populated during container startup.

### Next Steps
1. Test API endpoints with tools like Swagger UI or Postman
2. Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints
3. Test the authentication flow with JWT tokens
4. Implement additional backend features

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Models defined for all major entities
- ✅ API endpoints defined
- ✅ Serializers created with validation
- ✅ JWT authentication configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL database configuration
- ✅ Redis cache configuration
- ✅ Database fixtures created
- ✅ Initialization scripts created
- ✅ Service prediction system implemented
- ⬜ End-to-end testing

## Backend Population Plan

### Current Status Assessment
- Django backend is well-structured with proper models and API endpoints
- Models for Customer, Car, Service, ServiceItem, Invoice, and Notification are defined
- API endpoints with serializers are in place
- Authentication using JWT is configured
- Database is set up to use PostgreSQL
- Redis caching is configured

### Backend Population Plan
- Create database migrations to ensure all tables are properly created
- Create superuser account for admin access
- Populate the database with initial data:
  - Service intervals for common maintenance types
  - Sample customers for testing
  - Sample vehicles linked to customers
  - Sample services and service history
  - Sample invoices
- Configure and test Swagger API documentation
- Ensure all APIs are working correctly
- Test authentication flow

### Next Steps
1. Set up and configure PostgreSQL database
2. Run migrations and create initial superuser
3. Create fixture data for testing
4. Test and verify all API endpoints
5. Connect frontend to the backend
6. Test end-to-end functionality
7. Prepare for production deployment

## Recent Changes and Current Status

### Fixed UI Issues
- Fixed a critical UI error in the Vehicles page where the Select component was failing due to an empty string value
- Updated customer filtering to use "all" as the value instead of an empty string to comply with shadcn/ui Select component requirements
- Ensured URL parameters and UI state are properly synchronized
- Fixed vehicle creation/update error by transforming the customer field to customer_id for API calls
- Updated vehicle API to use PATCH instead of PUT for better compatibility with backend

### API Integration Updates
- Corrected API endpoints in the frontend to use `/cars/` instead of `/vehicles/` to match the backend structure
- All vehicle management operations (list, create, edit, delete) are now working correctly with the backend
- Customer filtering for vehicles is functioning properly

### Current Development Status
- Customer management is fully implemented (list, create, edit, delete)
- Vehicle management is fully implemented (list, create, edit, delete) 
- Customer-Vehicle relationship is properly established
- Authentication system is working correctly
- UI components are functioning as expected with proper shadcn/ui implementation

### In Progress
- Service history display for vehicles
- Vehicle details page with comprehensive information

### Known Issues
- Need to ensure proper validation for all form fields
- Some UI components need proper error handling
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement in some areas

## Next Steps
1. Complete the service history functionality
2. Implement the vehicle details page
3. Begin work on appointment scheduling
4. Add dashboard analytics
5. Improve error handling across the application

## Shadcn/UI Component Notes
Some important notes about the shadcn/ui components we're using:

1. `<Select.Item />` components must have a non-empty string value
2. Form validation should be done before submission
3. Always include proper loading states for async operations
4. Use toast notifications for user feedback
