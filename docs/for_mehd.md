# ECAR Project Status Update

## Current Status (Updated: March 31, 2025)

### System Components Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Django Backend | ✅ Working | Running in Docker with PgBouncer integration |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Working | Connected and migrations applied |
| PgBouncer | ✅ Working | Successfully pooling connections |
| Redis | ✅ Working | Available for caching |
| Nginx | ✅ Working | Serving the application |

### Docker Setup

The Docker environment is now properly configured with:

- Fixed permission issues in the backend container
- Updated Django backend to run properly
- PgBouncer configured with transaction pooling mode
- Redis working for caching
- Fully integrated environment with all services

### Admin Access

Django admin interface is available with the following credentials:

- **URL**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

### Development Options

You now have two ways to develop:

1. **Docker (Recommended)**:
   - Use `docker-compose up -d` to start all services
   - Changes to the code are reflected due to volume mounting
   - No need to worry about local dependencies

2. **Local Development**:
   - Several utility scripts provided for local setup:
     - `setup_local_env.sh`: Initial environment setup
     - `manage_local_db.sh`: Database management
     - `run_with_pgbouncer.sh`: Run with connection pooling

### Fixed Issues

We have resolved the following issues:

1. **PgBouncer Configuration**: Fixed connectivity issues with PostgreSQL
2. **Permission Issues**: Updated Docker user permissions for the backend container
3. **Container Stability**: Fixed backend container restarting issue
4. **Dependencies**: Added missing `django-debug-toolbar` dependency

### Upcoming Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**: Integrate React frontend
2. **API Extension**: Complete API endpoints for core functionality
3. **User Management**: Set up proper user roles and permissions
4. **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation

### Repository Structure

The project follows the structure defined in the ECAR Coding Rules document:
- Backend (Django + DRF)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis caching
- PgBouncer connection pooling
- Docker Compose for deployment

### Next Steps

1. Review the current setup and provide feedback
2. Begin work on frontend components
3. Complete core API endpoints
4. Set up proper user authentication flows

## Important Commands

### Docker Management
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View backend logs
docker logs ecar_project_backend_1

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Create a superuser
docker exec -it ecar_project_backend_1 python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run migrations
docker exec -it ecar_project_backend_1 python manage.py migrate

# Backup database
docker exec -it ecar_project_db_1 pg_dump -U ecar_user -d ecar_db > backup.sql
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup local environment
./setup_local_env.sh

# Run Django with PgBouncer
./run_with_pgbouncer.sh

# Check local services
./check_local_services.sh
```
