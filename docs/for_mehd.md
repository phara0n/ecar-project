# ECAR Project - Integration Status

## Current Status

We are implementing a React-based admin dashboard using Material UI and the Mantis template as a starting point. This dashboard will connect to the Django REST Framework backend running in Docker.

## Backend Integration Plan

The web admin interface needs to connect to the following backend endpoints:

1. Authentication (JWT)
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Token refresh mechanism

2. Customer Management
   - List/view/create/edit/delete customers
   - Search and filtering capabilities

3. Vehicle Management
   - List/view/create/edit/delete vehicles
   - Associate vehicles with customers

4. Service Management
   - Track service history
   - Schedule new services
   - Update service status

5. Invoice Management
   - Generate PDF invoices
   - View payment history

## Components Progress

### Theme Components (Completed)
- Created shadows.ts for custom shadow styling
- Created overrides/index.ts for Material UI component styling
- Created themes/index.tsx as the main theme provider

### Layout Components (In Progress)
- Created ScrollTop component for navigation improvement
- Created extended Breadcrumbs component
- Created Footer component
- Created Header component with various sections
- Created Profile component for user management
- Created Notification component for system notifications
- Created MobileSection component for mobile navigation that links to backend resources

### Pending Tasks
1. Configure Redux store with RTK Query to connect to backend APIs
2. Implement JWT authentication flow
3. Create dashboard views for each main data type (customers, vehicles, services, invoices)
4. Implement role-based access control based on user permissions from backend
5. Create forms for data entry with validation
6. Implement PDF generation/viewing for invoices

## Next Steps
1. Set up Redux store and API slices
2. Implement authentication with the backend
3. Begin creating the data visualization components
4. Connect each component to the relevant backend endpoints

## Integration Notes
- All API calls will use JWT authentication
- Backend is expected to be available at localhost:8000 during development
- Production will use the Docker-deployed backend
- Rate limiting and other security considerations to be implemented according to the backend specs

# ECAR Project Status Update

## Current Status

We've initiated a fresh start for the frontend admin dashboard, implementing a new structure with Toolpad Core integration.

## Recent Progress

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Created a new React project with Vite and TypeScript
   - Set up the folder structure following best practices
   - Configured ESLint and TypeScript settings

2. **Dependency Integration**:
   - Installed and configured Material UI components
   - Added Toolpad Core for advanced dashboard capabilities
   - Set up React Admin for resource management
   - Integrated Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Configured React Router with protected routes

3. **Basic Components Implementation**:
   - Created a main layout with responsive sidebar
   - Implemented login page with form validation
   - Built a simple dashboard with placeholder stats
   - Added 404 page for error handling

4. **Architecture Setup**:
   - Established Redux store architecture
   - Created authentication flow (currently using localStorage for demo)
   - Set up theme configuration with Material UI

## Technical Details

We've implemented the frontend with the following key technologies:

1. **Toolpad Core**: Providing advanced dashboard components and data-binding capabilities
2. **React Admin**: For rapid development of admin interfaces
3. **Material UI**: For consistent UI components
4. **Redux Toolkit**: For state management
5. **React Router**: For navigation and protected routes

## Current Challenges

1. **Compatibility Issues**: Toolpad Core requires React 18, but Vite sets up React 19 by default. We've used the legacy-peer-deps flag as a temporary solution.

2. **API Integration**: Currently using placeholder data. Will need to integrate with the backend API.

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Connect login form to actual JWT authentication API
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add proper route protection

2. **Resource Implementation**:
   - Create customer management interfaces
   - Build vehicle management screens
   - Implement service tracking
   - Develop invoice generation and management

3. **Dashboard Enhancement**:
   - Add real data visualization with Recharts
   - Create dynamic statistics cards
   - Implement activity feed
   - Add filtering and search capabilities

4. **Toolpad Integration**:
   - Develop custom Toolpad Core components
   - Create advanced data visualizations
   - Implement dynamic form builders
   - Set up dashboard customization options

## Technical Requirements Progress

- ✅ React with TypeScript foundation
- ✅ Material UI integration
- ✅ React Admin setup
- ✅ Redux Toolkit configuration
- ✅ Basic routing implementation
- ⏳ API integration with backend
- ⏳ Advanced form validation
- ⏳ Comprehensive data visualization

## Questions for Discussion

1. Should we prioritize any specific resource management screens?
2. What dashboard metrics and visualizations are most critical?
3. How should we handle user roles and permissions?
4. Do we need any specific Toolpad Core customizations for the project?
