### Backend API Endpoints
The vehicle management system will interact with the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/vehicles/` | GET | List all vehicles with optional customer_id filter |
| `/api/vehicles/` | POST | Create a new vehicle |
| `/api/vehicles/:id/` | GET | Get vehicle details |
| `/api/vehicles/:id/` | PUT | Update vehicle details |
| `/api/vehicles/:id/` | DELETE | Delete a vehicle |
| `/api/vehicles/:id/services/` | GET | Get service history for a vehicle |

### Data Model
The vehicle data model includes the following properties:

```typescript
interface Vehicle {
  id: number;
  customer: number;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  license_plate: string;
  vin: string;
  color: string;
  mileage: number;
  last_service_date: string | null;
  next_service_date: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### UI Components
The vehicle management system will include the following UI components:

1. **Vehicle List**
   - Table with vehicle details
   - Filtering and search functionality
   - Actions for edit, delete, and view details

2. **Vehicle Form**
   - Create and edit form with validation
   - Customer selection dropdown

   - Link to related customer

4. **Vehicle Dialog**
   - Modal dialog for creating and editing vehicles
   - Form validation
   - Success and error feedback

## Implementation Plan
