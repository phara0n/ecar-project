## Implementation Details

### Backend API Endpoints
The vehicle management system interacts with the following API endpoints:

| Frontend Name | Backend Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `getAll` | `/api/cars/` | GET | List all vehicles with optional customer filter |
| `getById` | `/api/cars/:id/` | GET | Get vehicle details |
| `getByCustomer` | `/api/cars/?customer=:id` | GET | Get vehicles for a specific customer |
| `create` | `/api/cars/` | POST | Create a new vehicle |
| `update` | `/api/cars/:id/` | PUT | Update vehicle details |
| `delete` | `/api/cars/:id/` | DELETE | Delete a vehicle |
| `getServices` | `/api/cars/:id/services/` | GET | Get service history for a vehicle |

> **Note**: The frontend uses "vehicles" terminology for consistency, while the backend API uses "cars" endpoints.

### Data Model
The vehicle data model includes the following properties:

```typescript
interface Vehicle {
  id: number;
  customer: number;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  license_plate: string;
  vin: string;
  color: string;
  mileage: number;
  last_service_date: string | null;
  next_service_date: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### UI Components

1. **Vehicle List (Implemented)**
   - Table with vehicle details
