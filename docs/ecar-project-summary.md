# ECAR Garage Management System - Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully set up the foundation for the ECAR Garage Management System, focusing on both backend components and initial DevOps setup:

1. **Django Backend (REST API)**:
   - Created core data models (Customer, Vehicle, Service, etc.)
   - Implemented JWT authentication with RBAC
   - Built comprehensive REST API endpoints with rate limiting
   - Added audit logging for critical models
   - Implemented PDF invoice generation with ReportLab
   - Set up email notification system with HTML templates
   - Added Redis caching for improved API performance

2. **DevOps Infrastructure**:
   - Set up Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
   - Configured NGINX + Gunicorn for production setup
   - Implemented Let's Encrypt SSL for secure connections
   - Created environment configuration with security settings
   - Set up basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation for all components
   - Maintained project plan and development status
   - Documented technical implementations and configurations

## What's Next

Our immediate next steps are:

1. **Complete Backend Enhancements**:
   - Migrate to PostgreSQL for production use
   - Implement AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Set up automated backup system with SFTP export
   - Add SMS notification capability via Tunisian gateway
   - Implement remaining security features

2. **Admin Web Interface Development**:
   - Set up React + Vite project with TypeScript
   - Implement Ant Design admin templates and components
   - Create dashboard with interactive analytics charts
   - Build management interfaces for all entities
   - Add CSV/Excel import/export functionality
   - Implement role-based access control (super-admin, technician)

3. **Mobile App Development**:
   - Complete React Native setup with TypeScript
   - Build secure token storage with react-native-encrypted-storage
   - Implement Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Create service history and vehicle management UIs
   - Add multi-language support with RTL layout for Arabic
   - Implement offline storage with SQLite

4. **DevOps & Deployment**:
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
   - Set up IP whitelisting for admin portal (admin.ecar.tn)
   - Configure production environment on Tunisian VPS
   - Implement monitoring with Sentry for error tracking

## Timeline

- **June-August 2025**: Complete backend enhancements and admin interface
- **September-October 2025**: Develop mobile app core features
- **November 2025**: Implement multi-language support and offline capabilities
- **December 2025**: Production deployment and user acceptance testing

## Technical Specifications

- **Backend**: Django + DRF with JWT authentication
- **Admin Interface**: React + Vite with Ant Design (TypeScript)
- **Mobile App**: React Native (TypeScript) with Redux Toolkit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- **Caching**: Redis for API and frequently accessed data
- **Infrastructure**: Ubuntu 22.04 VPS, Docker, NGINX
- **Security**: HTTPS, AES-256 encryption, IP whitelisting, audit logs

## Challenges & Considerations

- Ensuring data residency compliance (all data on Tunisian VPS)
- Implementing secure, efficient offline synchronization
- Setting up appropriate SMS gateway for Tunisian customers
- Balancing performance and security requirements
- Training garage staff on both admin interface and mobile app

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review completed backend components and enhancements
2. Discuss admin interface design mockups with Ant Design components
3. Plan mobile app development roadmap
4. Review security implementation and compliance considerations
5. Finalize timeline for remaining development phases
