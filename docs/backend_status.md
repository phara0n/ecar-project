# Backend Development Status
## Updated: April 2nd, 2025

## Overview
The ECAR backend is built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), providing a robust API for both the admin web interface and the planned mobile application. The backend is approximately 88% complete with core functionality implemented.

## Core Components

### 1. Models
All core data models have been implemented with proper relationships and validation:
- **User/Customer**: Extended Django User model with customer-specific fields
- **Car**: Vehicle information with customer relationship
- **Service**: Maintenance/repair services with status tracking
- **ServiceItem**: Individual parts or labor items for services
- **Invoice**: Payment tracking with PDF generation support
- **Notification**: Customer alerts for various events

### 2. API Endpoints
The following REST API endpoints have been implemented:
- `/api/auth/`: Authentication endpoints with JWT token support
- `/api/users/`: User management
- `/api/customers/`: Customer management
- `/api/cars/`: Vehicle management
- `/api/services/`: Service management
- `/api/service-items/`: Service parts and labor
- `/api/invoices/`: Invoice management with PDF generation
- `/api/notifications/`: Notification management

### 3. Authentication
- JWT-based authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
- Custom token serializer with user information
- Rate-limited login and token refresh views
- Password change API
- User registration endpoint

### 4. Documentation
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Enhanced schema definitions for better API documentation

## Current Status

### Completed
- Core models and migrations
- Basic API endpoints for all models
- JWT authentication with token refresh
- Swagger API documentation
- Basic validation and permissions
- Service status workflows
- Invoice status workflows with PDF generation support
- Notification system infrastructure

### In Progress
- Enhanced validation for complex scenarios
- Optimizing database queries
- API testing and refinement
- Documentation improvements

### Not Started
- Mobile app-specific API endpoints
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Enhanced reporting endpoints
- Integration with Tunisian SMS gateways

## Performance Optimizations
- PostgreSQL with PgBouncer connection pooling configured
- Database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Optimized serializers to avoid nested loops and N+1 query problems

## Testing Status
- Basic API endpoint testing completed
- Swagger API testing in progress
- Integration testing with frontend in progress
- Load testing not yet started

## Documentation
- API documentation using Swagger UI
- Custom schema definitions for complex endpoints
- Developer documentation in Markdown format

## Security Measures
- JWT authentication with proper token expiration
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Proper permissions for different user roles
- CORS configured for secure cross-origin requests

## Known Issues
1. Some complex API responses need optimization for mobile clients
2. PDF generation process could be improved with better templating
3. Email notifications need proper template configuration
4. SMS notification integration with Tunisian providers pending

## Next Steps
1. Complete API testing and refinement
2. Further optimize database queries for performance
3. Enhance documentation for mobile app developers
4. Prepare for mobile app integration
5. Implement more comprehensive test suite

## Dependencies
- Django 4.2.x
- Django REST Framework 3.14.x
- djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT authentication
