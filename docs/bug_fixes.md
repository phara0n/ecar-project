# E-Car Project - Bug Fixes Log

## April 2, 2025

### Fixed Swagger Documentation Schema Generation

**Issue**: Swagger documentation was generating 500 errors when accessing the OpenAPI schema due to serializer naming conflicts and circular references between serializers.

**Solution**:
1. Added `ref_name` attributes to all serializer `Meta` classes to provide unique references
2. Created a custom `FixedSchemaGenerator` class that properly handles serializer reference conflicts
3. Added `swagger_schema_fields` to problematic viewsets to ensure proper schema generation
4. Updated the `get_schema_view` configuration to use our custom generator

**Impact**: Swagger documentation now works correctly, allowing developers to explore the API through the UI and generate client code. Both the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI schema JSON endpoints work properly.

**Files Affected**:
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/serializers.py`
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/views.py`
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/urls.py`
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/swagger_wrapper.py` (new file)

**Verification**: Confirmed that both the Swagger UI (`/api/docs/`) and the OpenAPI schema (`/api/docs/?format=openapi`) are now accessible and working correctly.

### Fixed Circular Import in Serializers

**Issue**: Circular import error in the serializers where `ServiceSerializer` referenced `ServiceIntervalSerializer` which was defined after it in the file. This caused a `NameError` for `ServiceIntervalSerializer` when running migrations or using the API.

**Solution**: Rearranged the class definitions in `serializers.py` to ensure that `ServiceIntervalSerializer` is defined before `ServiceSerializer`. This resolved the dependency issue without requiring any changes to the models or API endpoints.

**Impact**: Fixed Docker container errors when running migrations. The service prediction system now works correctly, allowing for tracking service history and making accurate predictions for future maintenance.

**Files Affected**: 
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/serializers.py`

**Verification**: Confirmed that all migrations run successfully in the Docker environment and the API endpoints for service history are accessible.

## Previous Fixes

### Swagger Documentation Issue

**Issue**: Swagger API documentation generator was failing to correctly document viewsets that used custom serializer methods.

**Solution**: Implemented a bypass for viewsets that were causing issues by adding a `get_serializer_class` method that returns a simplified serializer for documentation purposes.

**Files Affected**:
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/views.py`
- `/home/ecar/ecar_project/backend/api/serializers.py`
