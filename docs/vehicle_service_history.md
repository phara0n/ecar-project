# Vehicle Service History Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the vehicle service history and predictions functionality, following the reference UI shown in the provided image.

## Features Implemented

1. **Service History Section**
   - Added a UI component to display and edit last service date and mileage
   - Implemented a date picker for selecting the last service date
   - Added an input field for the last service mileage

2. **Service Predictions Section**
   - Implemented automatic calculation of average daily mileage
   - Added prediction for next service date based on usage patterns
   - Added prediction for estimated mileage at next service

3. **Integration with Vehicle Form**
   - Updated the vehicle form data interface to include service history fields
   - Modified the vehicle dialog to include the service history component
   - Connected input fields to form state

4. **API Integration**
   - Updated the vehicle service API calls to include service history data
   - Ensured proper data handling in create and update operations
   - Added response handling for the service history data

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```tsx
ServiceHistorySection
├── Service History
│   ├── Last Service Date (with calendar picker)
│   └── Last Service Mileage (input field)
└── Service Predictions
    ├── Average Daily Mileage (calculated)
    ├── Estimated Next Service Date (calculated)
    └── Estimated Next Service Mileage (calculated)
```

### Calculation Logic

- **Average Daily Mileage**: Calculated by taking the difference between current mileage and last service mileage, divided by the number of days since the last service.
- **Estimated Next Service Date**: Based on the typical service interval (either time-based or mileage-based, whichever comes first).
- **Estimated Next Service Mileage**: Current mileage plus the estimated daily mileage multiplied by days until next service.

## Future Improvements

1. **Data Validation**
   - Add validation for service history inputs
   - Ensure mileage inputs make logical sense (e.g., last service mileage < current mileage)

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add visual indicators for upcoming services
   - Implement a service history timeline view

3. **Integration with Service Records**
   - Connect with actual service records from the database
   - Auto-populate last service data from the most recent service record
   - Show service history in a list below the form

4. **Prediction Refinements**
   - Improve prediction algorithm based on actual usage patterns
   - Account for seasonal variations in usage
   - Consider vehicle age and make in predictions

## Dependencies

- **date-fns**: Used for date handling and calculations
- **@/components/ui**: UI components from the shadcn component library
- **vehicle API service**: Backend API integration for saving and retrieving vehicle data
