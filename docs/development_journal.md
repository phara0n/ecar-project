# ECAR Project Development Journal

## April 6, 2024 - Project Clone and Initial Assessment

### Tasks Completed
- Successfully cloned the ECAR project repository
- Reviewed project structure and components
- Analyzed documentation to understand project architecture
- Identified main components:
  - Django backend with REST API
  - React frontend with ShadCN/UI
