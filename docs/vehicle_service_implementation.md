# Vehicle Service Management Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of vehicle service management features in the ECAR Garage Management System. The service management functionality allows administrators to track service history for vehicles, including service details, costs, and statuses.

## Components Implemented

### 1. VehicleServices Page (`/web-admin/src/pages/VehicleServices.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Displays service history for a specific vehicle
- **Features**:
  - View vehicle details (make, model, year, license plate, VIN, mileage)
  - Display a list of service records with details
  - Filter services by status (All, Completed, Pending, Scheduled)
  - Search functionality for service records
  - Add new service records
  - Edit existing service records
  - Delete service records with confirmation
- **State Management**:
  - Fetches vehicle details and service records from the API
  - Manages dialog states for adding/editing/deleting services

### 2. ServiceDialog Component (`/web-admin/src/components/ServiceDialog.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Provides a form dialog for adding and editing service records
- **Features**:
  - Form validation for required fields
  - Date picker for service date
  - Service type selection from predefined list
  - Status selection (scheduled, pending, completed, cancelled)
  - Fields for cost, mileage, technician, description, notes, and parts used
  - Error handling and display for form fields

### 3. API Integration (`/web-admin/src/lib/api.ts`)

- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /services/`: Fetch all services
  - `GET /services/{id}/`: Fetch a specific service
  - `GET /services/?vehicle={vehicleId}`: Fetch services for a specific vehicle
  - `POST /services/`: Create a new service record
  - `PUT /services/{id}/`: Update an existing service record
  - `DELETE /services/{id}/`: Delete a service record

## User Flow

1. User navigates to Vehicles page
2. User clicks the "Service History" button for a specific vehicle
3. System navigates to the Vehicle Services page, showing all service records
4. User can:
   - Add a new service record by clicking "Add Service Record"
   - Edit a service by clicking the edit icon
   - Delete a service by clicking the delete icon
   - Filter services by status using the tabs
   - Search for specific services using the search box

## Data Structure

### Service Record

```typescript
interface Service {
  id: number;
  vehicle: number;
  service_date: string; // ISO date format
  service_type: string;
  description: string;
  cost: number;
  mileage: number;
  status: string; // "scheduled", "pending", "completed", "cancelled"
  technician?: string;
  notes?: string;
  parts_used?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Service Scheduling**: Add calendar integration for scheduling upcoming services
2. **Service Reminders**: Implement notification system for upcoming services
3. **Service Packages**: Add predefined service packages with standard costs
4. **Service Reports**: Generate reports based on service history
5. **Technician Management**: Add management of technicians and their availability
6. **Service Cost Analysis**: Provide insights on service costs over time
7. **Mileage-Based Service Predictions**: Suggest upcoming services based on vehicle mileage

## Implementation Notes

- The service management system integrates with the existing vehicle management features
- Uses ShadCN UI components for consistent styling and user experience
- Implements responsive design for use on different screen sizes
- Service records are displayed in cards with detailed information
- Status indicators use color-coded badges for quick visual reference
- Skeleton loaders are used during data fetching for better UX
