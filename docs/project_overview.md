# ECAR Garage Management System - Project Overview

## Introduction

The ECAR Garage Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline garage operations, vehicle service management, and customer interactions. It provides a centralized platform for garage owners to manage appointments, track service history, generate invoices, and communicate with customers.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Django and Django REST Framework, with the following components:

1. **Core Models**:
   - Customer
   - Vehicle
   - Service
   - Appointment
   - Invoice
   - Notification

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - REST API with JWT authentication
   - Rate limiting for security
   - Redis caching for performance optimization

3. **Service Components**:
   - PDF Invoice generation
   - Email notification system
   - SMS notification capability (planned)

### Database Structure

The system uses PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for development:

- Relational schema with proper foreign key constraints
- Optimized indexes for frequent query patterns
- Migration system for database version control

### Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker:

- Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
- Separate containers for:
  - Django application
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache
