# Service Mileage Tracking Feature
## Updated: April 2, 2025

## Overview

We've implemented a service mileage tracking feature that captures the car's mileage at the time of service. This feature ensures that:

- Every service has a record of the car's mileage when the service was performed
- Mileage is automatically populated from the car's current mileage when creating a new service
- The mileage data can be tracked over time to analyze service history
- Service mileage follows logical validation rules to maintain data integrity

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Model Enhancement

Added a `service_mileage` field to the Service model with validation:

```python
service_mileage = models.PositiveIntegerField(_('Service Mileage'), blank=True, null=True, 
                                           help_text=_('The car\'s mileage at the time of service. '
                                                      'Cannot be less than the car\'s registered mileage.'))
```

Key characteristics:
- Field is optional (blank=True, null=True) to accommodate legacy data
- Includes helpful description text for admin users
- Stores positive integer values only

### 2. Mileage Validation Rules

We've implemented comprehensive validation to maintain data integrity:

```python
def clean(self):
    """
    Validate that service_mileage is not less than the car's current mileage.
    Also verify that mileage is not less than previous service mileages for the same car.
    """
    super().clean()
    
    if self.service_mileage is not None and self.car:
        # 1. Check service_mileage is not less than car's current mileage
        if self.service_mileage < self.car.mileage:
            raise ValidationError({
                'service_mileage': _('Service mileage cannot be less than the car\'s current registered mileage ({}).').format(self.car.mileage)
            })
        
        # 2. Check for previous/next services for chronological ordering
        # ... (validation code for chronological ordering)
```

The validation ensures:
1. Service mileage cannot be less than the car's current registered mileage
2. Service mileage must be greater than any previous service mileage for the same car
3. Service mileage must be less than any future service mileage for the same car

### 3. Automated Car Mileage Updates

When a service is completed, the system automatically updates the car's mileage if the service mileage is higher:

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    if old_status != 'completed' and self.status == 'completed':
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Update car's mileage if service_mileage is higher
        if self.service_mileage and self.service_mileage > self.car.mileage:
            self.car.mileage = self.service_mileage
            self.car.save(update_fields=['mileage'])
```

This ensures that the car's mileage record stays current with the latest service data.

### 4. Django Admin Interface

Enhanced the ServiceAdmin class with improved validation messages:

```python
form.base_fields['service_mileage'].help_text = _(
    'The car\'s mileage at the time of service. Will be auto-populated from car\'s current mileage when creating a new service. '
    'The mileage must meet the following requirements:<br>'
    '1. Cannot be less than the car\'s current registered mileage<br>'
    '2. Must be greater than any previous service mileage for this car<br>'
    '3. Must be less than any future service mileage for this car<br>'
    '4. When a service is completed, if the service mileage is higher than the car\'s current mileage, '
    'the car\'s mileage will be automatically updated.'
)
```

### 5. API Serializer Enhancement

Updated the ServiceSerializer to apply the same validation rules and handle mileage updates:

```python
def validate_service_mileage(self, value):
    """
    Validate that service_mileage follows the rules:
    1. Can't be less than the car's current mileage
    2. Must respect chronological order with other services
    """
    # ... validation code ...

def update(self, instance, validated_data):
    """
    When updating a service to 'completed' status, update the car's mileage if needed.
    """
    # ... when service is completed, update car mileage if needed ...
```

## Business Value

This feature provides several key benefits:

1. **Service History Tracking**: Creates a comprehensive record of a car's mileage at each service point
2. **Maintenance Planning**: Enables mileage-based service recommendations and planning
3. **Fraud Prevention**: Helps detect potential odometer fraud by tracking mileage changes
4. **Mileage Progression**: Ensures logical progression of mileage readings over time
5. **Automatic Updates**: Keeps the car's mileage record current with the latest service data
6. **Data Integrity**: Prevents illogical mileage entries through comprehensive validation
7. **Business Intelligence**: Allows analysis of service frequency relative to mileage

## User Experience

### Service Creation
- When creating a new service, the mileage field is auto-populated with the car's current mileage
- Admin users can override this value if needed but must follow validation rules
- The field includes clear help text explaining its purpose and validation rules

### Service Viewing
- The mileage is displayed in the service list view for quick reference
- Service detail views show the mileage prominently
- API responses include the mileage data for integration with other systems

### Service Completion
- When a service is marked as completed, if the service mileage is higher than the car's current mileage, the car's mileage is automatically updated
- This ensures the car's mileage stays current without requiring manual updates

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Original migration: `0005_service_service_mileage.py`
- Help text update migration: `0006_alter_service_service_mileage.py`
- Auto-population logic implemented in both admin interface and API
- Validation logic in model's `clean()` method ensures application-wide consistency
- Car mileage auto-update functionality keeps records in sync

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mileage-Based Service Alerts**: Create notifications when cars reach certain mileage thresholds
2. **Maintenance Schedules**: Implement mileage-based maintenance scheduling
3. **Reporting**: Add mileage-based reporting and analytics
4. **Mobile Integration**: Add mileage tracking to the mobile app for customer self-reporting
5. **Mileage History**: Add a dedicated view to show mileage progression over time
6. **Mileage Predictions**: Estimate future mileage based on historical patterns
