# Car Mileage Modification Restriction
## Added: April 2, 2025

## Overview

We've implemented a security feature that restricts the ability to modify a car's mileage after initial creation. This feature ensures that:

- Only superadmins can modify the mileage field after a car is created
- Regular admin users can set the initial mileage when creating a car
- Once saved, the mileage field becomes read-only for non-superadmins

## Implementation Details

### 1. Django Admin Interface

The restriction was implemented in the CarAdmin class by overriding the `get_readonly_fields` method:

```python
def get_readonly_fields(self, request, obj=None):
    """
    Make certain fields read-only for non-superusers when editing an existing car.
    - Mileage can only be modified by superusers after initial creation
    """
    readonly_fields = super().get_readonly_fields(request, obj)
    
    # If this is an existing car and the user is not a superuser
    if obj and not request.user.is_superuser:
        # Add mileage to readonly_fields if not already there
        if 'mileage' not in readonly_fields:
            readonly_fields = list(readonly_fields)
            readonly_fields.append('mileage')
            readonly_fields = tuple(readonly_fields)
            
    return readonly_fields
```

Additionally, we added clear help text to explain the restriction to users:

```python
def get_form(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add help text for mileage if the user is not a superuser and this is an existing car
    if not request.user.is_superuser and obj:
        form.base_fields['mileage'].help_text = _(
            'Only superadmins can modify the mileage after a car is created. '
            'Please contact a superadmin if you need to update this field.'
        )
        
    return form
```

### 2. API Serializer Enhancement

We also enforced this restriction in the API by making the mileage field read-only for non-superusers during update operations:

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    request = self.context.get('request', None)
    
    # If this is an update operation (instance exists) and user is not a superuser
    if self.instance and request and not request.user.is_superuser:
        # Make mileage read-only
        self.fields['mileage'].read_only = True
```

This ensures consistent application of the rule across both the admin interface and API.

## Business Rationale

This restriction was implemented for several important reasons:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures vehicle mileage records are accurate and cannot be easily modified by mistake
2. **Audit Trail**: Creates accountability as only superadmins can modify mileage after creation
3. **Service History Integrity**: Prevents inconsistencies in service history that might result from unauthorized mileage changes
4. **Business Intelligence**: Maintains accuracy of reporting and analytics that rely on mileage data

## User Experience

### For Regular Admins
- Can set the initial mileage when creating a new car
- After creation, will see the mileage field as read-only
- Help text informs them to contact a superadmin if mileage needs to be updated

### For Superadmins
- Can set the initial mileage when creating a new car
- Can modify mileage at any time after creation
- No restrictions on mileage field access

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The restriction is applied at both the UI level (Django Admin) and the API level (REST API)
- Implemented using Django's built-in permission system (is_superuser)
- No database changes were required - this is purely a permission-based restriction
- The implementation preserves all other edit capabilities for regular admins

## Testing

You can verify this implementation works correctly by:

1. **Testing as a regular admin:**
   - Create a new car and set the mileage
   - Save the car
   - Attempt to edit the car - the mileage field should be read-only

2. **Testing as a superadmin:**
   - Create a new car and set the mileage
   - Save the car
   - Edit the car - the mileage field should be editable

## Future Considerations

1. **Audit Logging**: Consider adding a log entry each time a superadmin modifies a car's mileage
2. **Approval Workflow**: Possibly implement a request system where regular admins can request mileage changes that require superadmin approval
3. **History Tracking**: Add a mileage history feature to track all changes to a car's mileage over time
