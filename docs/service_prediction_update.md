# Service Prediction System Update

## Overview

We've updated the service prediction system to follow specific requirements regarding maintenance intervals and prediction logic. These changes ensure that service predictions are more appropriate for the business requirements.

## Key Changes

### 1. Standardized Service Intervals

All service intervals have been updated to use:
- **Time Interval**: 365 days (1 year)
- **Mileage Interval**: 10,000 kilometers

These values provide a standard maintenance schedule that aligns with manufacturer recommendations for most vehicles.

### 2. Prioritized Time-Based Calculations

When insufficient mileage data is available, the system now prioritizes time-based calculations. This ensures predictions are always available, even for vehicles with limited usage data.

**Before**: Required both time and mileage data for accurate predictions, leading to potential gaps or unreliable predictions for new vehicles.

**Now**: Falls back to time-based predictions (365 days) when mileage data is insufficient, ensuring all vehicles have reasonable maintenance schedules.

### 3. Improved Data Sufficiency Checks

Added more robust checks to determine if there's enough data for mileage-based predictions:
- At least 7 days of mileage update history OR
- At least 30 days of service history

This prevents making predictions based on overly small data samples that might not represent typical usage patterns.

### 4. Better Fallback Mechanism

Enhanced the fallback prediction logic to consistently apply the 365-day (1 year) and 10,000 km intervals when standard calculations aren't possible.

## Implementation Details

The changes were primarily made in the `Car` model:

1. Updated `_generate_fallback_prediction()` method to use 365 days and 10,000 km
2. Refactored `calculate_next_service_date()` to:
   - Better evaluate data sufficiency
   - Prioritize time-based calculations with insufficient data
   - Always return reasonable predictions

3. Updated database: All existing `ServiceInterval` records have been modified to use the standardized intervals (365 days, 10,000 km)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All vehicles follow the same service interval guidelines
2. **Reliability**: Every vehicle gets a prediction, even with limited data
3. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and explain to customers
4. **Compliance**: Aligns with common manufacturer recommendations for annual service

## Testing and Verification

The updated system has been tested by:
1. Running the `update_service_predictions` management command for all vehicles
2. Verifying that predictions are generated with the new intervals
3. Testing scenarios with both sufficient and insufficient mileage data

## Next Steps

1. Monitor prediction accuracy over time
2. Gather feedback from service staff about prediction usefulness
3. Consider manufacturer-specific adjustments if needed for certain vehicle types
